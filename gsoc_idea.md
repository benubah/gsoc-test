## Background

The R community has participated in the Google Summer of Code since 2008 with a successful run over time.
As the R community is expected to continue its expansion in a more data-driven world, the effective 
utilization of programs such as Google Summer of Code could help increase the pace of R's user-base expansion, 
diversity and adoption.

So far there has been 185 projects done within the GSoC program under the R organization. There is no count of
mentors that have participated so far, and on a year-by-year basis to understand the trend of mentorship and how
it affects the program.

Perhaps, it is important to recognize the efforts of mentors, through a data-driven listing of most valuable - those
who have committed the most time to mentor the future R users and developers.
Also to those students who participated in GSoC in the past and who are now mentors.
Encouraging the cycle of GSoC students becoming mentors could have a great impact on the R community and its
development.

Many proficient users of R, could be spurred to become mentors by seeing how thriving the RGSoC community is via data-driven
rendering of past accomplishments, thereby relieving over-laboured mentors who spend much more time mentoring.

Students who have project ideas could search through a data-driven list of mentors to find those mentors who have mentored similar
projects. Mentors could also find co-mentors from a searchable list of past mentors.


So in this project, the proposal is to curate the past accomplishments of R-GSoC in a data-driven manner that can help the R community
discover and track R-GSoC projects, their students, mentors, and work-products. Developing it on GitHub will allow everyone of
them contribute to it.


## Related Work

Hans Borchers started to compile a list of GSoC projects here: https://github.com/hwborchers/gsoc-r 

This list developed to the one found here under rstats-gsoc repo:  https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/blob/master/projects.csv

There is a data table and chart of projects here:  https://benubah.github.io/rcentral/gsoc.html


## Details of Coding Project

This project hopes to complete the list of GSoC projects found under rstats-gsoc by:

- Completing mentor names that are incomplete, and making their names consistent through out the list.
